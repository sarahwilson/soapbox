# Accountability on Hard Mode

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a company in search of success, must be in want of employees that demonstrate accountability.

I have yet to work at an organization where accountability didn’t show up someplace. Sometimes it was enshrined in company values, sometimes it was called out when evaluating candidates, often it came up when reviewing employee performance. But that seems reasonable. I think if you expand that thinking we want to be surrounded by people who step up to a challenge and follow through on what they say they are going to do. Everyone has had an experience with someone who has let down the team and how yuck that feels.

So how do you set up systems to prevent that?

Accountability on easy mode is about vocalizing what you want to do. So picture a team standup. “Today I want to complete that review for Steph’s changes to the sign up page.” Ok, that’s easy enough. Rituals that happen on a regular cadence allow for setting expectations on what a team member should be expressing when it comes to what they want to achieve. It’s the start of the accountability buddy loop. If I say the thing out loud, and I know other people have heard it, I’m more likely to keep that commitment.

But of course things don’t always work out. Maybe a critical issue came in, maybe I had a family emergency that needed my attention, maybe I’m struggling with motivation around a task, maybe I don’t yet have the skills to complete the work. Whatever the reason, enter mode 2: accountability on medium.

Accountability on medium mode is about owning up. I said I was going to do a thing and lo and behold, I didn’t do the thing. What now? Am I afraid to speak up? Will this affect how my teammates view me when they find out I can’t do the thing I thought I could? Will this affect my bonus next month? Will my boss be angry, or worse, disappointed?!?

Leveling up from easy to medium accountability mode is more about the environment rather than the individual. Let’s work this one backwards. Someone misses a deadline that you both agreed to. Why? They were struggling with the complexity in the task and couldn’t figure out how to get it done. Well why didn’t they bring this up? They were afraid to admit that they didn’t know how to complete the work. Why didn’t they ask for help before the deadline? They were afraid of looking incompetent in front of you and being judged.

Like many things, of course there’s an xkcd for this situation:

Feeling comfy enough to ask for help is a sign of healthy relationships. Individuals know they won’t be laughed at or judged for making a mistake or not knowing something and colleagues are happy to share their knowledge to get the work done on time as promised. If you want to learn more about measuring and improving psychological safety, start with [Google’s Re:work site](https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness#foster-effective-team-behaviors). Or if you want the TLDR:
1. Have your senior people lead by example by asking for help when they need it, which will normalize this behaviour for less experienced team members.
2. Focus on learning being the true value of the work rather than simply the execution of a task. In your retros, ask what the team learned and celebrate that growth.
3. Learn to ask lots of questions so you can understand how someone is approaching the problem. What information do you have that they might not yet know because they haven’t learned it yet?

Ok, so. You’ve set up your teams so that they have recurring rituals to talk about what they are going to achieve, you’ve fostered safety so that they can ask for help, but every so often you’ll still have situations where people don’t speak up. What now?

Accountability on hard mode is the ultimate end level boss. You’ll have to set up some training, probably do some workshops and practice the hell out of it. Hard mode is when you provide feedback to a colleague about them not meeting an expectation.

Let’s do an easier example first. Your best friend has decided that they want to improve their health. They have asked you to be their accountability buddy so they have someone they can message to say “Today I will go to the gym”. Yesterday was supposed to be a gym day but there’s nothing on Strava.

Personally, I like Situation, Behaviour, Impact to help explain and set clear lines around expectations.

- Situation: Hey I know you are working so hard to improve your health lately and I’m proud of your progress so far. Yesterday you told me that you were going to hit the gym.
- Behaviour: But I didn’t see a new workout on Strava for it and I wanted to ask what happened
- Impact: Because missing workouts won’t help you achieve your goal of being healthier and I want to support your goals.

Well, that’s all good and well. But that’s a best friend and talking to them is easy. Work colleagues and friends can be mutually exclusive.

The key is to remember three things:
1. Given enough time, not only will infinite monkeys type out the works of Shakespeare, but you will end up in a situation where you will have to give a colleague critical feedback. Eventually, shit will hit the fan and you’ll need to have an important conversation around expectations. OR. They will need to have one with you… Invest in the work relationships you have today so that hard conversations will be easier tomorrow. Learn more about what your colleagues do outside of work for fun, step out of the office for a coffee break or choose a walk-and-talk for your next meeting to change up your environment.  Conversations with conflict are easier (not easy, but easier) if you have an existing foundation to rely on.
2. Since we’re all people just trying to do our best work and enjoy life, take care of our loved ones and pay some bills at the same time, remember it’s a journey for everyone. None of us is perfect. We all make mistakes. Anecdotal studies have shown that 98.3% of the time, you’re likely in a misunderstandment with someone. So start there and seek to get on the same page before attributing malicious intent or assigning blame. Likely they need support with a side of clear direction and expectations.
3. As hard as that conversation might be, do unto others. I have yet to meet someone who doesn’t want to be pulled aside and asked about it when they’ve messed up. If that resonates with you, and you want others to step up to help guide you on your way, you have to be ready to help them too.

Accountability is one of those things that’s never really done. In life, there are always going to be  opportunities to practice regardless of what level you are at. If you find yourself struggling in these areas, take a step back and ask why you are having difficulties - are you not yet invested in the changes you want to make? Are there scared thoughts getting in the way of being vulnerable or asking someone to be vulnerable with you? Regardless, recognize and reflect that working through those feelings will allow you to take the action that you want and need to to achieve your goals. Examine how you can change up your environment to make harder things easier.
